  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Traveling ðŸŒŽ - Most of my traveling is roadtrips to hiking/camping destinations, but I'm always looking for cheap flight deals too!
      One site I like to watch is <a href="https://www.theflightdeal.com/">The Flight Deal</a></li>
    <li>Cooking ðŸ¥˜ - Beforing asking me to make something, I should admit I'm not really a great cook. BUT, I do like try new recipies I
      find online. One of my fravorite food blogs to follow is <a href="https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/">The Half-Baked Harvest</a></li>
    <li>Golfing â›³ - Have golfed on/off for many years. It goes in phases really I guess. Work has a pretty big PGA following (DTN provides
      forecasts to the PGA!), so recently I've had motivation to work on my golf game.
      Look out for me on the <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/">PGA Tour</a> website soon!</li>
